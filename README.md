# RAMDrive-Runner
I built this because I couldn't find a program that was as convenient as I wanted it to be.

**This is dependent on ImDisk being installed and on the PATH**

This program creates a RAMDisk with your selected game's files so they load much faster while you are in the game.

You select a folder where your games as stored (like a steam folder) and then you select the folder you want to create a RAM Drive for and you mount that drive.  

The program will create a symbolic link in the name of the selected folder and point to the ram drive.  Unmounting cleans up after itself.

I have never written WPF before, I totally don't know what I am doing and i just used GPT4 to tell me what to code.
